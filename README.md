** PIZZZA **

<!-- OVERVIEW -->

Is a modern version of 'Tic Tac Toe' or 'Noughts & Crosses'.

It is designed to be played by two people from one computer. Whoever would like to take the first turn selects either the face or pizza icon under the 'Pick Player' heading and then selects a square in the game board.

<!-- ** HOW TO PLAY ** -->

The icon they choose will display inside the square they click on. Then it's the second player's turn, they are automatically assigned the remaining icon. This icon will display in any square they click on.

The game will not let a player take more than one turn at a time.
The game will not let a player override a square that is already taken.
If no player icon is clicked the first player is automatically assigned the pizza icon.
Once the game starts (eg. the first square is selected), players can not change icons or select an icon if they didn't before starting the game.

The first player to get three icons in a row (vertically, horizontally or diagonally) wins!

If all 9 squares are selected and no-one has won, it is considered a draw.

Players can use the 'reset button', displayed on the winning and draw overlay to play again.

The game uses local storage to keep track of the number of wins per player. This total is displayed on the winning screen of each individual player.

<!-- BUGS -->

a. The 'reset button' moves around the screen depending on how big the browser is. The positioning needs to be fixed to prevent this.

b. The icons inside the 'pick player' buttons and the squares are linked so currently the size of the squares and the buttons needs to be the same for the icons to appear centred. It would be great to separate these so they can be used at different sizes.

<!-- SUGGESTED FUTURE UPDATES  -->

a. The total for each player should show on both winning screens so the players can compare scores each time, motivating them to play again. Alternatively the players scores could tally and stay visible at all times.

b. The game board could grow in size at each new level.
